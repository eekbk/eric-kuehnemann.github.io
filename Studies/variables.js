/**
* VARIABLES:
*
* 0. To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program, we can use variables. 
* Variables are named identifiers that can point to values of a particular type, like a
* Number, a String, Boolean, Array, Objecto or another data-type. Variables are called so
* because once created, we cam CHANGE the value (and type of value) to which they point.
*
* 1. To create a variable we use the keyword, var, followed by a name (id or alias) for 
* our variable.
*
* 2. There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment).
